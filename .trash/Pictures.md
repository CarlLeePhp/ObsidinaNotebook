#### Paste pictures at the same folder

We can past a picture into a note directly. It will be named as "Pasted image xxxx", xxxx will be a random number.
What I want are:

- Pictures will be saved at the same folder as the note.
- Pictures will be saved in a specific folder with a random name.

![[Pasted image 20230524202205.png]]

As I cannot hide pictures from the navigation. I built a folder for all the attachments, Assets.
