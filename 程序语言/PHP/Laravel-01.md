## Installation

#### PHP Extension

Check the requirements for the website. I can use this code to check whether a extension was installed or not.

```php
extension_loaded(string $name):boolean
```

And install any extension by ('BCMath' for example):

```shell
apt install php-bcmath
```

#### Composer
