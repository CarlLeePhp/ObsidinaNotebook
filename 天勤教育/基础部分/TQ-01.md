#### Software Bug (Formal Definition)

1. The software doesn't do something that the product specification says it should do. (not functional)
2. The software does something that the product specification says it should not do. (e.g. uploading photos and deleting local photos)
3. The software does something that the product specification doesn't mention. (send user privacy data)
4. The software doesn't do something that the product specification doesn't mention but should. (common sense, photo compression)
5. The software is difficult to understand, hard to use, slow, or - in the software tester's eyes -- will be viewed by the end user as just plain not right. (user experiences)



#### What is a "bug"?

+ **Error:** a human action that produces an incorrect result
+ **Fault:** a manifestation of an error in software
  + also known as a defect or bug
  + if executed, a fault may cause a failure
+ **Failure:** deviation of the software from its expected delivery or service
  + (found defect)



Failure is an event; fault is a state of the software, caused by an error.



#### Why do faults occur in software?

+ Software is written by human beings
  + who know something, but not everything
  + who have skills, but aren't perfect
  + who do make mistakes (errors)
+ Under increasing pressure to deliver to strict deadlines
  + no time to check but assumptions may be wrong
  + systems may be incomplete
+ If you have ever written software ...



在这节课里，可能会出现在以后面试中的问题有：

1. 为什么需要软件测试。

> 进行软件测试是为了检验软件是否满足预期要求。是软件工程完工确实完工的一个证实。
>
> 进行软件测试是为了找出软件中存在的错误，保证软件质量。
>
> Software testing could check whether the developed software meet the requirements or not. It also could identify defects. When the defects are fixed, the quality of the preduct could improve.

2. 请你说说对BUG的定义和理解

> 软件没有打到期望的或不说自明的目标，软件发生了不期望发生的行为。软件难以理解和使用。
>
> A bug is that a software do some unexpected things or cannot meet expected requirements
>
> A bug could be an error, a fault or a failure. When an error is made by someone, it creates a fault in the software and then could cause a failure in operation.

3. Bug产生的原因。

> 开发人员对要求的误解；
>
> 开发人员的技能水平；
>
> 人为错误，人都会犯错，有限的时间下完成有限的工作；

The reasons could come from developers and external factors.

Firstly, no one is perfect. So anyone might make mistakes.

On the other hand, working under great pressure or without enough time may cause more bugs produced. For example, a video game called E.T. published by Atari had only 5 and half weeks for developing. That might be why it became one of the worst video games.



4. 软件一定是需要测试的吗？

   Yes, any software as a product shall be tested.

   Any software should meet clients' requirements and have a reasonable quality. Software testing is the way to ensure it. On the other hand, if a client receive a bad product from a company, that company might lose the client.

   > 对于Q1,软件是可以不去测试的，因为测试的目的是为了保证质量。但软件本身只是工具，它的目的是为了去实现特定的商业目标或价值，因为是以商业目的而驱动的，所以测或不测，测到什么程度，都是以商业价值来衡量的。如果一个软件需要花相对比较长的时间去测试来获得一个让人比较放心的质量，但如果花了这个时间的话，有可能软件的发布时间就会推迟，这个推迟的时间可能会造成商业上的巨大损失，比如说竞争对手抢先一步把产品推向市场，用户花了钱买了竞争对手的产品，在这个时间后，再推出一个质量好一点的产品，用户也没有预算再去购买一个同类产品了，比如说手机，大部分人不可能在三个月内换两个手机，所以有时候产品哪怕牺牲产品质量，先不测或少测也要先上市，占先手。在测试工作中，有时候是在抢时间 ，有时候也是在成本和质量之间作出一个平衡。

5. 是所有的 Bug 都需要 fix 吗？

   Not all bugs should be fixed. It depends on how much the fixing cost and the cost will be caused by the bugs. Both directly and indirectly cost should considered, like clients' feeling when they find a bug.

   > 对于Q2也是一样的，改还是不改还是看这个问题对严重程度，在商业中的哪个阶段，还要看公司对于质量的重视程度。很多时候都只要是不太大的问题，都是先上市，看用户反馈，然后再慢慢改。
