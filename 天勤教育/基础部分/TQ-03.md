#### What Exactly Does a Software Tester Do?

+ The goal of a software tester is to find bugs.

+ The goal of a software tester is to find bugs, and find them as early as possible.

  广义上的 bug，包括产品说明文档里的问题。

+ The goal of a software tester is to find bugs, find them as early as possible, and make sure they get fixed.

  也不是说所有的都要改，还要根据经费等。



#### What Makes a Good Software Tester? （7分钟）

+ They are explorers

+ They are trouble shooters 找到问题的敏锐的直觉

+ xxx relentless 不放弃的，已经吵架了，可以把 BA 叫过来，把自己的观点说出来，同时对开发说我是对事不对人。

+ xxx creative

+ xxx (mellowed) perfectionists

+ They exercise good judgment

+ xxx tactful and diplomatic 

  谈话的艺术。你这有问题 --> （操，你会不会用，就说是 bug）。我不确定这个是不是我没用对，但得出的结果有点不对 --> （操，可能是个 bug）。

  对事不对人，不要带着“你看看，你的问题被我发现了，xxx 都会比你写的好。”

+ xx persuasive 有说服力的，要把严重性说出来。站在用户的角度来和产品经理说。和开发说，是现在改还是被接收方发现后再改，哪个更好点。

看别人报的 bug 对提升 explorers、trouble shooter 和 creative 很有帮助，多想想为什么会从这个角度考虑，才能找到特定的 bug。



#### Testing Principle （38分钟）

1. Testing everything is impossible

   Too many input, too many output, too many ways to implement the software, no clear definition of 'right' behaviour in Specification



#### Why not just "Test everything"?

在这个例子里，如果每个测试用例用 1 秒钟，需要约 17 天。如果每个测试用例需要 10 秒，则是 34 周；10 分钟则是 40 年。



#### Exhaustive testing?

**What is exhaustive testing?**

+ when all the testers are exhausted x
+ when all the planned tests have been executed x
+ exercising all combinations of inputs and preconditions v

**How much time will exhaustive testing take?**

+ infinite time x
+ not much time x
+ impractical amount of time v



#### How much testing is enough?

+ it's never enough x
+ when you have done what you planned x
+ when your customer / user is happy x
+ when you have proved that the system works correctly v
+ when you are confident that the system works correctly x
+ it depends on the risks for your system v



#### There is Always One More Bug

"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs but never to show their absence." ---- Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1972



#### How much testing? （56 分钟）

+ It depends on RISK
  + risk of missing important faults
  + risk of incurring failure costs  // incur 引起
  + risk of releasing untested or under-tested software
  + risk of losing credibility and market share
  + risk of missing a market window
  + risk of over-testing, ineffective testing



#### So little time, so much to test ...





#### 面试题

1. 你认为成为一个好的测试工程师需要哪些素质，为什么？

   A good tester should be a explorer, a trouble shooter, tactful and diplomatic.

   Firstly, a good tester should be a explorer. Tester not only test a software according the specification, but also beyond it. Bugs often come from where is not clear in the specification. So tester should be a explorer to search these unclear places.

   Then a good tester should be a trouble shooter. When a bug appears, he should aware it is a bug immediately, and record it as sure as possible. Without this a tester might miss many bugs everyday.

   The last one is tactful and diplomatic. For example, when a tester talk with a developer that a bug was found in his codes. The tester may meet with resistance from the developer. But if the tester say he is not sure whether he got the right way, but something strange happened, the developer might aware there is a bug.

   > explorer  / ikˈsplɔːrə(r) /
   >
   > tactful  / ˈtæktfl / **adj.** 
   >
   > diplomatic  / ˌdipləˈmætik /   resistance  / riˈzistəns / 

2. 我们说保证软件的良好质量，就要去测试软件所有的一切，做穷举（exhaustive）测试，这句话对吗？为什么？

   No. The time and budget for any project is limited. So testing everything is impossible. When the testing is enough, we believe the quality of the software is good. How much testing is enough depends on the risks for the system.

3. 在一个项目里面，项目的budget是有限的，项目的交付时间是有限的，项目的人力资源也是有限的，在这些有限的条件下，怎样的测试才算足够？依据是什么？

   When you have proved that the system works correctly, the testing is enough.

   And it depends on the risks for the system. The risks could be not only missing important defect and causing failure costs, but also market share. After risk analysis, testing plan should be made according to the level of risk and the budget. High level of risk things are priorities.

   >  priorities  / praiˈɔrətaiz /

4. 通过风险凭估可以决定测试活动中的哪些工作安排？

   老师给的答案：Depend on the risk for the software, it can determine which part need to be **tested first**, which need to be **tested most,** which part need to be **thoroughly** tested and which part **doesn’t need to be tested.** 

   > thoroughly  / ˈθʌrəli/

   Through risk analysis, a level of risk list could be built. Then according the project budget, the range of testing could be determined. It will tell us how much testing is enough. // 被老师驳回“不是很准确”

   Risk analysis might affect schedule, resource planning and test criteria during a software testing work.

   For example, in order to seize market share, there is very limited time for testing.

   Firstly, it affect the testing schedule directly. Then the testing team maybe need more human and system resource. It also could force to reduce product quality. So it could affect the test criterial.

   测试活动有哪些：
   
   + 消化软件需求；
   + 确定测试方向；
   + 设计测试用例；
   + 搭建测试环境；
   + 依据测试用例找 BUG；
+ 出具测试报告；
   + 确定软件质量是否通过。

   有哪些风险：
   
   + 错过严重漏洞、漏洞爆发引起的损失、测试或不测试的风险、市场份额、过度测试和无效测试
   + Organizational Risk -> e.g. lack of technically skilled members
   + Technical Risk
   + Business Risk
