#### So little time, so much to test ...

+ Test time will always be limited
+ use RISK to determine:
  + what to test first
  + what to test most
  + how thoroughly to test each item
  + what not to test (this time)
+ use RISK to
  + allocate the time available for testing by prioritising testing ... (按重要性测试)

以按照风险的考虑，来制定测试的策略、计划。

测试的时间总是有限的，基于风险来确定什么是优先的。

不仅在时间上需要分配，在优先级上也要



#### Using Risk Matrix in Risk Assessment





#### 面试题

1. 按照优先级来安排测试工作的依据是什么？

   The basis for prioritising testing is RISK. We should ensure having enough time to handle important testing.

   > prioritize / praiˈɔrətaiz/

2. 请解释风险矩阵的用途，以及风险矩阵中 12 个风险项的意思？分别给出自己的例子。

   从不同维度进行分析，我们把它放到这个矩阵里面。最后加在一起作为这个项目的风险级别。

   > matrix  / ˈmeitriks /
>
   > consequences  / ˈkɔnsikwəns /
   
   Using risk matrix can clarify the attendant risks and possible consequences of carrying out or bypassing specific test activities. Each item in the matrix could be analysed, then the risk of project could be concluded by the summary of them. There are 12 risk items in the matrix.
   
   + The first one is Knowledge of area. It means the more familiar the tester is to the area, the fewer defects will be missed. For example, a tester is going to test a video record software. If he doesn't familiar with it, he might record a video then check whether it is successful. If he know more about how it works, he might check the synchronisation of video and voice and effect of object's speed. 知识储备是什么，比如说项目要实现的商业目标；
   + Next one is Reputation. It means when a problem occurs how much it will affect company's reputation. If a report of a bug spread on the Internet, it will seriously affect the company's reputation. 名望，外部对公司形象的损失，对个人的信誉度。比如一个 bug 被用户发现后在互联网传播，对公司品牌形象的损失就很大。
   + Next one is Impact on Users. It means how serious is a bug affect users. If the software is for medical use, it may take away the patient's life. However, if the software is for entertainment, it is not so serious.用户多的时候风险大。
   + Next one is Loss of Money. It means the more loss could be, the more risk is. If one bug could cause a building collapse and the other one could cause a bulb burned down. So the former bug is more risky.
   + Next one is Type of Change. Different types of modifications have different effects on the system. For example, modifications of UI may not affect other parts of the system. But a modification for a interface in the server side might affect many modules. 现在的系统都比较复杂，负载均衡，传到服务。。简单的工作背后的。。。是相当复杂的。Bug 修改后，就带来了一定的风险。比如 UI 修改了，风险就较低。比如服务器端，接口修改，那么风险就比较大。
   + Next one is Security. When a security problem occurs, whether it could cause serious results or not. For example, if a software is involving bank account and password. Its security risk might be high as it may cause huge money loss. 银行，账户转账，功能简单，但是安全出问题的话影响较大。缓冲区溢出，发送大量的 xxx。比如娱乐性的项目，不涉及金钱、账号等，安全性可能较低。
   + Next one is Regression of Existing features. When a bug is fixed, it might affect other parts of the system. If its effect is wide, many regression test should be done. So this type of risk could be high. 考虑回归测试的工作量，如果会影响整个系统的部分，其风险应评为高。
   + Next one is High Traffic. This risk depends on the amount of users. For example, almost all Chinese are using WeChat. If any problem occurs, it might affect huge users. So this type of risk should be high. 比如微信，用户非常庞大。
   + Next one is Detectability of failures. When a problem occurs whether it is detectability. If a problem is serious but not detectability, it will be a high risk. 可排查性。
   + Next one is Ability to revert. It means the difficulty of reverting back to last stable version. For example, a web application could revert back easily, because there is no client program. So this risk could be low.。
   + Next one is How visible. It means when problem occurs, whether it is visible for users. If a problem is invisible, it could be fixed before before users realize it. So the risk is low. 当问题发生时，对用户而言是否可见。如果用户看不到，那么影响较小。
   + The last one is Blocking. It means when problem occurs, the process cannot continue. For example, if a problem occurs in login module for bank. Any operation should be after login, so customers cannot do any thing. It is blocking. 如果问题出现，客户将不能做其它操作，如果是这样这个地方的风险较大。
