#### 第一次模拟面试

1、为什么不使用录制回放这种简单快速的方式来编写测试用例？

通用性差，不稳定、可维护性差。回答时需要总结结论，不论先后。

It has poor stability, efficiency and maintainability.

Firstly, it is not stability. When any element is changed, the whole case must be recorded from scratch.

Then, it is not efficiency. Each steps must be done manually for a recording.

The last one is that it is difficult to maintain. Because it is not easy to modify or reuse any part of a recording. Some test cases are only slightly different. But all test cases must be recorded one by one.

Record and Replay is good for:

+ Individuals with little or no programming knowledge.
+ Filling in the gaps of Selenium tests and transitioning from mostly manual testing.
+ Lightweight automation for smaller tests.
+ Non-technical roles doing one-off tests.
+ Teams where members outside of QA take part in some testing.

Selenium is good for:

+ Highly technical practitioners that know the ins and outs of writing a Selenium script.
+ Enterprise teams with an experienced QA team, expansive web applications, and a high volume of users.
+ Creating robust suites and end-to-end tests.
+ The largest reach in terms of automation speed and code coverage.



2、哪些地方（测试类型）适合自动化测试，哪些地方不适合？

适合的： and so on.

不合适的：ET、user experience、look and feel。

Test types suitable for automated tessting are: Regression Testing, Smoke Testing, Basic Acceptance Testing, Reliability Testing, Stress Test.

The types of testing are not suitable for automated testing are: exploratory testing, user experience testing, and look and feel testing.



Look and feel: [https://testqspider.blogspot.com/2012/01/what-is-look-and-feel-testing.html#:~:text=The%20testing%20of%20the%20appearance,as%20look%20and%20feel%20testing.&text=Not%20only%20different%20browsers%20affect,same%20browser%20cause%20the%20differences.](https://testqspider.blogspot.com/2012/01/what-is-look-and-feel-testing.html#:~:text=The testing of the appearance,as look and feel testing.&text=Not only different browsers affect,same browser cause the differences.)



3、implicit wait 和 explicit wait 的区别？

Implicit wait: It instructs the web driver to wait for some time by poll the DOM. Once you declared implicit wait it will be available for the entire life of web driver instance. By default the value will be 0. If you set a longer default, then the behaviour will poll the DOM on a periodic basis depending on the browser/driver implementation.

Explicit Wait + Expected Conditions: It is the custom one. It will be used if we want the execution to wait for some time until some condition achieved.



4、什么是 SpecFlow 以及它的优势？

SpecFlow is a testing framwork that lets us define application behaviour in native languages.

SpecFlow connects acceptance Testing and Spec. SpecFlow is an open-source tool for bridging the communication gap between domain experts and developers. It allows non-technical people, such as product owners or business analysts, to write acceptance tests for the system that we're developing. 



5、一个登录页面，如何设计不同用户登录这个 feature?

A scenario outline could be used to store the information of users. The information will be used line by line for the testing.



6、对一个登录页面怎么使用 PO 模式进行封装？

这个问题主要考察的是你对po模式思想的理解。采用po模式进行封装的主要价值就是体现对界面交互的封装，这样可以让我们的测试案例可以更加关注与业务而非界面细节，提高测试案例的可读性。

封装的主要步骤就是， (1).在页面层通过学过的方法找到要测试的元素，如用户名输入框、密码输入框、登录按钮等 (2).封装主要的业务功能操作，比如这里的登录功能（3).在用例层面，每次调用登录功能时候，只是调用方法，不需要关注页面层面。如果后面页面层面有改动，我们需要修改页面层中的方法就可以了。 好好的理解下这个题，这个是我们自动化测试的一个很核心的思想。

Firstly, a "LoginPage" class is created for the login page. The UI elements in this page should be built as propeties. And the funcational operations, like login, should be built as methods. There could be multiple steps in one functional operation.

Then, these methods should be called for each testing case. When anything is changed in the login page, the "LoginPage" class should be modified only.
