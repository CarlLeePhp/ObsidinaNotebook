#### Two players, one goal

A brief history of ASP.NET Core and Angular's most recent achievements.

#### A full-stack approach

#### MPA, SPA, PWA, and NWA

Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) are those web applications that work in a traditional way: each time the user asks for (or submits) data to the server, they render a new page that is sent back to the browser.

Single-page applications (SPAs) try to provide the same user experience as a desktop application. There are some of the key features provided by a competitive SPA nowadays:

- No server-side round trips. A competitive SPA can redraw any part of the client UI without requiring a full server-side round trip to retrieve a full HTML page.
- Efficient routing.
- Performance and flexibility.

Progressive web application

Native web applications (NWAs) are web applications which is 100% supported out of the box by recent standards-compliant web browsers.
